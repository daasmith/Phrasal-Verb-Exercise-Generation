Little Johnny hated going to see the dentist. It wasn't that his dentist was nasty; it was that Johnny wasn't too fond of sweets. 
His dentist had warned him that his teeth would fall out if he kept up eating candy. Time and time again, the dentist had told him to cut out sweet food or at least cut down on the amount he ate.
As he lay down in the dentist's chair, all the horrible memories from his last visit came back to him. On that occasion, the dentist had to pull out one of his teeth! The pain was terrible - even with the anaesthetic the dentist had given him. When the anesthetic wore off it was difficult for him to eat or chew anything at all. 
This time the check up was much better. His dentist checked out his teeth, made him wash out his mouth with pink liquid and then told him to spit it out into the sink.  That was it. No problems and no pain! Johnny was delighted and so was his dentist. Johnny has finally learned his lesson and was taking better care of his teeth. Well done, Johnny!
